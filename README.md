# Next.js Links Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where links, even with correctly defined paths, fail to navigate to the intended pages. The problem is often related to improper configuration or unexpected behavior within the routing system.

## Problem

The provided `MyComponent` utilizes Next.js's `<Link>` component to create links to the `/` (home) and `/about` pages. Despite the pages' existence, clicking the links doesn't result in page navigation.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the routing in the application is correctly set up and there are no conflicts within the file structure or configurations.

- Verify page file existence and location.
- Check the `next.config.js` file for custom routing configurations that might interfere.
- If using custom server setups, confirm the server is handling routing properly.
